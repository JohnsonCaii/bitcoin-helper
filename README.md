# Bitcoin Helper
🤔 For those people who are really hate to use THIRD-WALLET app (not just because they do not provide private key to user but also centralized) and wanna manange that digital asset by themselves.

So I'd like to add more COIN helper such as BCH, ETH, LTC in the future.

BTW, u guys can also write things up if interested. 🌝
